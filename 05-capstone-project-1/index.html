      Hi there! I'm an aspiring full stack developer with a deep passion for web
      development and computers. My journey in tech began with a fascination for
      how websites are built and has since grown into a full-blown pursuit of
      mastering both front-end and back-end technologies.

      <h3><summary>My Coding Journey</summary></h3>
      <details>
        I started with the basics of HTML and CSS, mastering the art of creating
        and styling web pages. JavaScript quickly became my tool of choice for
        adding interactivity, and I have since delved into popular frameworks
        like React to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces. <br />

        On the server side, I have been honing my skills in Node.js, creating
        robust back-end systems with Express.js. Working with PostgreSQL has
        allowed me to efficiently manage and query relational databases,
        ensuring data integrity and performance. <br />

        Bringing together my front-end and back-end skills, I love building full
        stack applications using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React,
        Node.js). This combination allows me to create seamless and efficient
        web solutions. Deploying these applications using platforms like Heroku
        and Netlify has been an exciting part of my journey. <br />

        I believe in the power of continuous learning and community
        collaboration. I regularly take courses on platforms like freeCodeCamp,
        Codecademy, and Coursera to stay updated with the latest in web
        development. Contributing to open source projects has not only improved
        my coding skills but also connected me with a vibrant community of
        developers. <br />

        Problem-solving is at the heart of what I do. I enjoy tackling coding
        challenges on LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codewars, constantly pushing
        myself to think critically and innovatively. This practice has sharpened
        my skills and prepared me for real-world coding scenarios. <br />

        As I continue my journey, I'm excited to build more projects, explore
        new technologies, and connect with like-minded professionals. My goal is
        to create impactful web applications that enhance user experiences and
        solve real-world problems. <br />

        Let's build something amazing together! <br />
